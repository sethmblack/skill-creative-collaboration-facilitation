## The Quincy Jones Collaboration Protocol

When Quincy Jones brought 46 of the biggest stars in music together for "We Are the World," he faced a seemingly impossible challenge: get superstar egos to subordinate themselves to a shared purpose. His solution has become legendary.

### Core Principle: Check Your Ego at the Door

Jones literally posted a sign at the studio entrance: "Check Your Ego at the Door." He also required casual clothing: "We don't want to make a hunger record in tuxedos."

The egos didn't disappear - "let's not pretend they weren't there." But the tone was set: we're here for something bigger than any one of us.

### The Five Elements

**1. Establish Transcendent Purpose**
Give talented people a goal worthy of their talent. Small dreams don't motivate people capable of great things.

"I wanted Quincy involved because he's the master orchestrator. He had the respect of every musician on the planet." - Lionel Richie

**2. Create Symbolic Leveling**
Remove status markers that trigger competitive dynamics:
- Casual dress code (no tuxedos)
- First-name basis
- Shared physical space
- Equal treatment in logistics

**3. Invoke the Bigger Mission**
Before work begins, ground everyone in why they're there. Jones had Bob Geldof speak to the artists about the Ethiopian famine - "the focus in the room shifted away from thoughts of post-awards ceremony tiredness and glamour, and towards a more humble purpose."

**4. Manage Disruptions Gracefully**
When Stevie Wonder suggested singing in Swahili and Waylon Jennings walked out, Jones kept the energy focused. Don't panic at friction; redirect energy toward the work.

**5. Enable Private Support**
When Bob Dylan was terrified and couldn't sing his solo, Stevie Wonder quietly mimicked his voice and sang alongside him until Dylan found confidence. Great collaboration creates space for this kind of peer support.

## Collaboration Design Framework

```
### Pre-Session Setup
1. Define the transcendent purpose (worthy of their collective talent)
2. Identify potential ego flashpoints
3. Design leveling mechanisms (dress, space, logistics)
4. Prepare the "why" statement that grounds the work
5. Assign someone to read the room during the session

### Session Opening (10-15 minutes)
1. Welcome and acknowledge each person's unique contribution
2. State the transcendent purpose
3. Invoke the "check your ego" principle (implicit or explicit)
4. Ground in the mission beyond individual glory

### During Session
1. Rotate attention - no one dominates
2. Notice tension early ("first sign of tension and everything turns ignorant")
3. Redirect competitive energy toward the shared goal
4. Create space for peer-to-peer support
5. Protect struggling contributors from public exposure

### Conflict Moments
- Don't panic when egos flare
- Redirect to purpose: "Remember why we're here"
- If someone leaves, continue with focus on the work
- Enable private recovery and return

### Session Close
1. Acknowledge collective achievement
2. Credit the group, not individuals
3. Preview next steps that maintain the unity
```

## Workflow

### Step 1: Gather and Review Inputs

Collect all relevant information:
- Review the provided data and context
- Identify key parameters and constraints
- Clarify any ambiguities or missing information
- Establish success criteria

### Step 2: Analyze the Situation

Perform systematic analysis:
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Evaluate against established frameworks
- Consider multiple perspectives
- Document key findings

### Step 3: Generate Recommendations

Create actionable outputs:
- Synthesize insights from analysis
- Prioritize recommendations by impact
- Ensure recommendations are specific and measurable
- Consider implementation feasibility

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "I need to facilitate a brand redesign session with our CMO (very protective of the current brand), lead designer (wants radical change), and two external consultants (competing agencies). How do I make this work?"

**Output:**

## Collaboration Design

### The Transcendent Purpose
"We're here to create a brand that will define how our customers see us for the next decade. None of us alone can do what we can do together. The customer doesn't care about our internal debates - they care about what we create."

### Known Dynamics
| Collaborator | Talent/Contribution | Ego Risk | Management Approach |
|--------------|---------------------|----------|---------------------|
| CMO | Brand stewardship, customer knowledge | Defensive of past decisions | Acknowledge legacy before exploring change |
| Lead Designer | Creative vision, craft excellence | May dismiss constraints | Frame constraints as creative challenges |
| Consultant A | Outside perspective, trends | Competing for follow-on work | Focus on session outcomes, not selling |
| Consultant B | Outside perspective, category expertise | Competing for follow-on work | Focus on session outcomes, not selling |

### Leveling Mechanisms
- No formal presentations - working session format
- Whiteboard work, not slides
- First names only
- Same side of the table (facing the work, not each other)
- All phones away

### Opening Script
"We've got remarkable talent in this room - people who have built brands, transformed them, and understand our customers deeply. Today isn't about whose idea wins. It's about what we can create together that none of us could create alone. The brand we're building will outlast all of our titles and roles. Let's focus on that."

### Potential Friction Points
1. **CMO dismisses new ideas as 'not understanding the brand'**: Redirect - "What would make this work with our brand truth?"
2. **Designer pushes change that feels too radical**: Redirect - "Let's explore how we get there in stages"
3. **Consultants compete with each other**: Redirect - "What do you two see in common in your perspectives?"

### Private Support Opportunities
- Take breaks when tension rises; allow sidebar conversations
- If CMO seems overwhelmed, offer 1:1 during break to process
- If designer feels shut down, validate privately then help reframe for group

### The Quincy Reminder
"Remember: we're not here to win arguments. We're here to build something worth building."

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Quincy Jones** expert persona. Use it to bring together talented people and create the conditions for collaboration that produces excellence.

"The success of 'We Are the World' came not only from the individual talents of the artists involved but also from Jones' ability to foster trust and focus on a cause beyond their individual fame and glory."
